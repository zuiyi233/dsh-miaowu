## Host entry

The Host entry registers nine contributions in the current Cordis context:

1. An `oh-story` Skill provider for 13 pinned novel Skills.
2. A `short-drama` Skill provider for 10 pinned Drama Skills.
3. A `novel-to-game` Skill provider for 7 pinned game-production Skills.
4. A `video-recap` Skill provider for 6 pinned video Skills.
5. The `oh_story_role` tool, backed by DSH's `spawn` provider and bounded by the caller's visible tools.
6. The read-only `oh_story_bundled_reference` tool for exact, pinned Role craft references.
7. The side-effect-free `oh_story_production` UI-intent tool for semantic production focus, explicit sequence order and Agent-owned job projection. Cosmetic canvas layout remains creator-controlled Session state.
8. `tools/pre-execute` and `tools/post-execute` hooks for long-form outline and Tracking checks.
9. A Session-scoped creative file route for Markdown, text, JSON, JSONL and previewable production media, plus separate game and video-preview routes.

All four providers prepend a small DSH bridge at load time. The bridge maps upstream platform integration points to the current Session, tools, approvals and UI while leaving craft instructions and references intact. The short-drama bridge fixes the Drama Skills 0.6 creator-first boundary: episodes keep only the requested subset of up to five creator-facing Markdown documents, no empty documents or nominal stages are backfilled, persisted reviews remain readable Markdown while oral reviews write nothing, production keeps the exact-job confirmation contract, and legacy v0.5 structured projects are never migrated in place. The NovelToGame bridge keeps `game-adaptations/<project>` as the project root, `build/app/index.html` as the playable authority and `qa/verification.json` as the six-check QA authority. The video bridge keeps each project under `video-recaps/<project>`, uses `work/` as the upstream work directory, leaves upstream manifests and timelines authoritative, and keeps API keys process-only. It does not introduce a second Agent runtime, render queue, project database or editing timeline. Bundled legacy validators remain maintenance resources and do not reactivate the old JSON/JSONL workflow.

Specialist Roles preserve their upstream structured file tools and intersect them with the calling Agent's visible DSH tools. Roles that reference shared `story-setup` craft material receive only the plugin's `oh_story_bundled_reference` reader when it is visible. The reader exposes an allowlist built from the pinned package, resolves every file canonically inside that package, rejects path escape, and fails closed if a scoped same-name tool shadows it; project Skills can therefore neither redirect Role references nor inject replacement instructions. Roles never probe `.claude`, `.codex` or other deployment directories.

The prose guards and file route resolve the live Agent and use that Agent's DSH `FileSystem`, so their view of the workspace matches native tools under local, sandboxed and remote providers. The route first applies the same Host, Origin and Fetch Metadata trust boundary as DSH's native browser API, then uses the Agent filesystem and sandbox policy for resolution, containment, reads and atomic `replaceIfVersion` writes. Media preview is read-only and extension allowlisted. Media whose canonical process path is a real file inside the host-visible workspace root is streamed with HTTP byte ranges and no whole-file buffer; every other backend uses the DSH bounded byte API and retains a 256 MiB fallback cap. Unparseable or unsupported Range headers are ignored per RFC 9110, and only satisfiability failures answer 416. Editable access remains limited to documented creative project directories. Loopback is trusted by default; explicit non-loopback authorities must be declared through the plugin's `trustedHosts` config. Child Sessions do not receive an editor route.

Playable game assets are served from workspace `build/app` directories or the bundled example through a separate content route. Every path is canonically contained, files are size-limited and HTML receives a restrictive CSP. On loopback, the Browser swaps `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` for the iframe origin, preserving same-origin storage inside a game while isolating generated scripts from the DSH application origin. The fallback sandbox omits `allow-same-origin` when an alternate origin is unavailable.

## Browser entry

The Browser entry uses two official extension slots:

| Slot | Contribution |
| --- | --- |
| `shell.overlay` | Declares the Session-scoped three-column creative workbench seat |
| `tool.call.toolview` | Compact `oh_story_role` invocation view |

The workbench is not unconditional. DSH is a general Harness, so the bridge claims the conversation layout only for a Session whose workspace actually holds creative work: creative files, a workspace game project or a video project. The bundled game example ships with the plugin and never counts. Without creative work the plugin renders nothing at all, and the official conversation, its Composer, its `Ctrl/Cmd+S` and its file links stay exactly as DSH renders them; the workspace request still follows Agent mutations, so the first creative file an Agent writes hands the layout over inside the same Session. The creator can also take the layout back at any time from any of the four workbenches, which leaves only a launcher floating at the conversation column's own corner. That choice overrides what the workspace contains, and because the DSH Session Store is not persisted it is kept per workspace in browser storage, so a new Session in the same workspace and a restarted DSH both honor it.

The bridge portals its workbench into the stable `conversation.session` layout seam. 小说/短剧 retain the file-tree/editor/Chat three-column surface. 游戏 switches to a focused two-column surface: the generated-game preview owns the larger left region and the mounted official conversation remains the right region, so Chat state, streaming, tools, Todo, approvals, history and Composer continue to use DSH implementations.

视频 uses the same left-Studio/right-Conversation geometry without importing an NLE runtime. Project discovery reads a small allowlist of upstream artifacts and skips frame, ASR-chunk, cache and TTS-segment directories. The player exposes source, `edited_source.mp4` and the assembly output, keeps the loaded version stable during Agent writes, and makes the creator opt into a new version. The artifact panel is read-only; `recap_run_manifest.json`, `recap_phase.json`, `timeline.json` and `assembly_manifest.json` remain the lifecycle authority. The runtime preflight probes the DSH host process for Python, ffmpeg/libass, ffprobe and whether credentials are present, never their values; the Agent's own execution world is reported by upstream `video-recap --doctor`.

Game Studio discovers workspace projects from `game-adaptations/*`, fingerprints `build/app`, retains the current playable version during an Agent build, and exposes only Preview plus read-only project-file inspection. The Game Studio and Preview panel stay mounted while project files, Chat, or the same Session's 小说 workspace are visible, preserving the live iframe and player state. A new digest is never loaded merely because the iframe lost focus; the creator explicitly chooses `载入新版本`. Narrow layouts show either Studio or Chat at a time instead of shrinking the playable surface below a usable width; both regions and their drafts remain mounted.

QA remains invisible infrastructure. NovelToGame Skills, packaged QA artifacts and automated gates retain the six-check contract, while Game Studio intentionally renders no QA tab, pass/fail cards, badge or release score. The upstream schema has no build digest, so the Host-side API never guesses that an imported PASS belongs to the current preview: it reports that record as `UNBOUND`, binds an observed QA revision to its preview digest, and changes the binding to `STALE` when the preview digest moves. The immutable bundled example is `PINNED`.

The overlay declares a strict Session child slot, so DSH supplies `sessionId`, `useSession` and a per-Session workbench Store without manual Session subscriptions. DSH intentionally omits a tool-only Assistant from the visible Chat `partial`; its official Step location data still publishes that Assistant's streamed blocks, which the Browser reads from `chat.timeline`. Executing and nested tools come from `runningCalls`. The Browser restricts both sources to supported creative paths and projects them over the last disk version. Once a tool settles, the workspace route is the authority again. The file tree preserves every project directory level; selection changes also switch the 小说/短剧 mode and expand the matching group plus all ancestor directories.

For a selected Drama 0.6 episode, the Browser parses only that episode's existing five Markdown documents into a disposable `short-drama/v1` projection. Explicit visual IDs remain stable across title edits; duplicate IDs, generated fallback IDs, unresolved sources/references, malformed production headings and conflicting motion blocks produce navigable diagnostics instead of silent guesses. It provides shot and asset cards, cross-document navigation, a Session-scoped and episode-keyed job projection, workspace-backed media versions, sequence validation and a draggable creator-controlled relationship canvas. A project media library indexes previewable results already visible through the Agent FileSystem across episode and delivery directories; manual cross-episode image references remain episode-keyed Session preferences and are included only in an explicitly prepared video job. Switching episodes rebuilds document/media projections and isolates jobs, version selections, manual references, sequence and canvas layout by episode directory. The projection never writes a parallel database. Prompt editing stays in the owning creator Markdown or the normal DSH Chat instead of being duplicated on production cards.

Image and video buttons inject an exact prepare-only `/short-drama-produce` request through the current Session's official `ConversationController`. The Session projection remains `awaiting_confirmation` until the creator confirms the displayed preview and the executing Agent records that same job ID through `oh_story_production`; only then does it become running. Queue items are matched to the official Conversation Queue and can only be removed through its Queue API, while stopping an active Turn calls the official Conversation cancellation API and preserves the remaining Queue. Media-to-target and media-to-job association uses exact path tokens, never substring containment. A completed paid Turn without correlated workspace output becomes `dispatched_unknown`, not an automatically retryable failure. DSH remains the sole owner of tools, provider/model choice, approvals, cancellation, durable history and Trajectory. Optional GPT Image 2, Seedance and MiniMax Music adapters implement verified request contracts, but their external configuration, account access and credentials remain outside the plugin. Results become versions only after they appear under the selected episode or delivery directories in the Agent FileSystem.

Agent operability follows that ownership boundary. The Agent can directly execute a confirmed production turn with the current Preset's visible tools and can change canvas content by editing creator documents or writing media results, which rebuilds the projection. It can also call `oh_story_production`; successful durable tool calls are replayed in official DSH Chat order and idempotently applied to the per-Session Browser Store. Layout, zoom, selected references and sequence preferences remain interface state rather than creative truth. The tool emits no file, media, network or provider side effect and explicitly does not count as creator confirmation, so production authority stays with Drama Skills and DSH approvals rather than a hidden sidecar runtime.

When the Agent is idle, a capture listener recognizes existing workspace file links inside the official conversation. Those links update the same selection state used by Agent file following. Human-dirty buffers take precedence over incoming disk or Agent state and surface a per-file conflict with explicit disk/local resolution. DSH's unpersisted Session Store retains drafts and editor navigation across in-process Session switches and releases them with the Session lifecycle. File reads carry the opaque DSH filesystem version; saves use that version as an atomic precondition and reject stale writes instead of overwriting concurrent disk changes.

Markdown rendering is implemented as a safe React element tree with tables, task lists, quotes and fenced code. Raw HTML is treated as text and external links are limited to HTTP(S). JSONL is parsed one record per source line, keeps malformed lines visible, and summarizes stable IDs, types and statuses. Every preview shares its buffer and save path with source editing.

## Upstream assets

`packages/knowledge/oh-story/manifest.json` pins the Oh Story release, commit, 13 Skills, 7 Roles, agents version and every file hash. `packages/knowledge/drama/manifest.json` performs the same role for 10 Drama Skills. `packages/knowledge/novel-to-game/manifest.json` pins NovelToGame 0.3.0, all 7 Skills and the complete playable `jin-ping-mei` example. `packages/knowledge/video-recap/manifest.json` pins video-recap-skills 0.4.0, all 6 Skills and every bundled file hash.

The Drama Skills standalone dashboard server and assets are omitted during synchronization because the creator surface is supplied by the DSH workbench. Oh Story's login/CDP rank scrapers and platform deployment helpers are also excluded; the two scan Skills use DSH-native, visible-tool research instructions instead. Synchronization rejects Python bytecode, `__pycache__` and `.DS_Store` workspace pollution before manifests are generated. Remaining workflow, reference, validation and production-adapter resources are packaged with their upstream paths.

## Product boundaries

Each workbench projects the pinned upstream contract; none of them becomes a
second source of creative truth.

- Short drama reads the five creator-first Markdown documents per episode. The
  production view projects them through the lightweight `short-drama/v1`
  protocol and reports duplicate ids, dangling references and malformed
  headings against their source lines. Empty documents are never pre-created,
  and stages the creator did not ask for are never backfilled.
- The game workbench keeps QA in `/game-qa`, native tool results and
  `qa/verification.json`. It adds no QA tab, card or badge of its own.
- The video workbench offers version switching, stage hints and artifact
  viewing. It carries no multi-track timeline or heavy editor.
- `oh_story_production` opens and focuses semantic targets, sets shot order and
  records the jobs the Agent actually ran. It never edits creative documents,
  never generates media, and never stands in for a paid-production
  confirmation.
- Bundled media exists for offline interaction regression only and is never
  presented as a provider success.
- The video runtime check reports only whether Python, ffmpeg/libass, ffprobe
  and keys are ready inside the DSH Host process. Provider credentials are
  never sent to the browser; `video-recap --doctor` remains authoritative.
- Short-drama media comes from provider adapters, never from the DeepSeek model.
  The plugin registers the four bundled adapters (GPT Image 2, Seedance,
  MiniMax H3, MiniMax Music) in a credential-free adapter config outside every
  project, names that file and each adapter's required variables to the
  `short-drama-produce` Skill, and the 生产 view reports per adapter whether
  the Host environment has them. Presence only is reported; values never
  reach the Skill text, the browser, or a project file. A creator-owned config
  named by `OH_STORY_DRAMA_ADAPTER_CONFIG` is used untouched.

## Release boundary

The build produces Host and Browser bundles under `packages/dsh-plugin/lib`, copies all four knowledge sets, and rejects known parallel-runtime markers. Generated `lib` and tarballs are release artifacts and are excluded from Git history.
