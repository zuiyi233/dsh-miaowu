# Release process

`@dsh-miaowu/dsh` is distributed as the same prebuilt tarball through npm and
GitHub Releases. A release is created only from a `v<package-version>` tag.

## One-time npm setup

The npm account used for the first publication must be allowed to publish the
public `@dsh-miaowu/dsh` package. Store a granular publish token as the repository
secret `NPM_TOKEN`; never commit it or put it in an issue, workflow file, or
release note.

After the first publication, configure npm Trusted Publishing for:

- repository: `zuiyi233/dsh-miaowu`
- workflow: `release.yml`

The workflow requests an OpenID Connect identity and publishes with provenance.
Once Trusted Publishing is verified, the long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` secret can be
removed.

## Cut a release

1. Update the root and package versions, installation examples, and
   `CHANGELOG.md` for the intended release.
2. Run `pnpm verify:release` locally.
3. Commit and push `main`.
4. Create and push the matching `v<package-version>` tag.

The release workflow then:

1. repeats the complete verification suite;
2. builds and inspects a clean installable tarball;
3. checks that the tag and package version match;
4. uploads the tarball and SHA-256 checksum to a GitHub Release;
5. publishes the identical tarball to npm with provenance.

The GitHub Release and npm steps are idempotent so a failed workflow can be
safely re-run.

## Verify the public installation

Do not announce a release until the registry reports the exact version:

```bash
VERSION=0.1.6
npm view "@dsh-miaowu/dsh@$VERSION" version dist.integrity
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 plugin --profile web add "@dsh-miaowu/dsh@$VERSION"
```

The GitHub Release tarball remains a registry-independent installation path:

```bash
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 plugin --profile web add "https://github.com/zuiyi233/dsh-miaowu/releases/download/v$VERSION/dsh-miaowu-$VERSION.tgz"
```
